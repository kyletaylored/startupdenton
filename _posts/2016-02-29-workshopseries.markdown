The TechMill Workshop Series consists of community-led tech classes across a variety of topics. By working with local universities and libraries, we bring together all current publicly available classes to provide a single calendar for tech education. The series is completely free to anyone wanting and willing to learn new technologies or improve their own professional skill set.

Classes are tagged by different categories, allowing you to customize your own track based on your interests: front-end development, back-end development, big data, hardware, design, etc.
