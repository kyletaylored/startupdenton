Open Denton is a grassroots open data initiative to promote public datasets, improve government transparency, expand awareness, and increase civic engagement in Denton, Texas. We are a diverse group of people with a wide variety of technical and non-technical skills. This project is supported by a larger nationwide initiative called What Works Cities.
