Denton's startup community has seen explosive growth recently, setting the stage for unprecedented interest in our city for building startups. TechMill is a non-profit group assembled by members of the community with a common goal: **make Denton the best place to start an independent, creative, bootstrapped tech business.**

With it's unique creative culture, major universities, and independent businesses, Denton has the potential to be the most unique startup city in North Texas. TechMill was founded to help Denton realize this potential. We are building, organizing, and advocating the Denton startup scene.
