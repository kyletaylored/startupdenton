DrawAttention started when in November of 2014, Kyle made a whiteboard sticker for his laptop and posted a picture of it on Facebook. It exploded with likes, comments, and requests to buy one. That's it, that's all it took. He spent $13 on a domain name, whipped up a logo, and in 10 hours - built a site with e-commerce, analytics, social media, and email marketing.
