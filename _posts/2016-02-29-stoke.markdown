A coworking space and entrepreneur center for innovators, startups, and dreamers in the heart of Denton, Texas.

In partnership with the Dallas Entrpreneur Center and backed by the City of Denton, local entrepreneurs and freelancers can join the collaborative space for $150/month, or $250/month for a dedicated desk. For those looking for a more private option, offices are available for $550/month.

Denton is already bursting at the seams with startup and tech meetups, and Stoke aims to help bring community initiatives together under one roof to build a truly collaborative technology hub.
