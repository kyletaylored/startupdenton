Students at the University of North Texas with ideas from tech innovations to new businesses can visit the Innovation Greenhouse and find on- and off-campus resources to make their ideas come to life.

The Innovation Greenhouse aims to help students apply what they learn in the classroom, and use knowledge gained through hands-on experience to succeed in the rapidly growing innovation field.

The Innovation Greenhouse helps students outline structure for their ideas, refers them to networking and internship opportunities, and holds workshops on investment and other topics to foster innovation. The Greenhouse provides referrals for students to on-campus resources, including UNT’s Murphy Center for Entrepreneurship, housed in UNT’s College of Business, as well as faculty at Discovery Park who can help students with access to lab space and provide mentoring.
